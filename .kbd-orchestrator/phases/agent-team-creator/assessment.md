# Assessment: agent-team-creator
Date: 2026-09-24
Status: assessment draft for independent review; no implementation approved or complete.

## Scope and user requirements
Create and manage coding-agent teams in a project or at UAR/BossFang scope. Targets: UAR, Codex, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Kimi Code, MiniMax's own mcode CLI, OpenCode, and DeepSeek Harness. Include a novice task-to-role guide, skill assignment, hard/medium/low model selection using capability and cost information, handoffs through Karpathy logs and shared memory, native agent/subagent/plugin/marketplace surfaces where supported, complete configuration preservation, documentation and both Docusaurus sites. New scripts/hooks must be Node.js and TypeScript 7. Identical new runtime in full and mini; edits only inside the two authorized repositories. User additionally requires every KBD stage and correction of observed workflow inconsistencies.

## Cross-tool progress and process correction
The phase has zero registered changes and zero completed implementation changes. Assess was entered through the typed CLI. Two early OpenSpec commits are draft work, not approved Spec/Plan artifacts. The initial type scaffold was withdrawn and adapter implementation delegation stopped after the user corrected the process. The earlier harness research is evidence available for Analyze, not proof that Analyze or its adversarial review completed.
Current phase state, rather than project-wide counters, determines this phase's progress. Other worktrees have ongoing work; their changes must not be restored or published by this phase.

## Implementation completeness
| Area | Status | Evidence / gap |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Native skill inventory and packaging | PARTIAL | Existing inventory and Claude/Codex distributions provide reusable packaging. They do not constitute native team support in eight harnesses. |
| KBD lifecycle and logging | PARTIAL | Canonical CLI, stage gates and Karpathy receipts exist. Stage documentation and runtime projections have the conflicts below. |
| Guided task-to-team creation | MISSING | No agent-team-creator skill or runtime exists in the inspected inventory. Novices need outcome-oriented questions, reasons for roles, ownership and a one-agent alternative. |
| Portable team/task contract | MISSING | Existing KBD phase/change/task state is not a general-purpose harness team manifest. Avoid adding a second owner for the same KBD work item. |
| Cross-harness handoff | PARTIAL | Existing KBD handoff schemas and boundary receipts carry process context; portable agent identity, task transfer, artifact provenance, ownership acceptance and destination-native configuration remain undefined. |
| Model routing | PARTIAL | liter-llm/KBD model roles exist. A selectable team/role/skill/task policy with discovered models, actual supported capabilities and known/unknown cost is absent. |
| Shared memory | PARTIAL | KBD event mirroring, recall and local receipts exist. A team handoff is not automatically a canonical KBD boundary event or permission grant. Other memory providers require verified contracts. |
| Eight-harness exports | MISSING | Native schemas differ. Preserving opaque options is necessary but is not proof that a native runtime supports them. No complete adapter certification exists. |
| Documentation / sites | PARTIAL | Both sites and catalogs exist; team workflows and configuration coverage documentation are missing. |
| Portable TypeScript 7 runtime | MISSING | Existing runtime and compiler baselines differ. New runtime needs a reproducible pinned build and shipped artifacts, with no dependency on full-pack-only tools. |

## Observed conflicts requiring reconciliation before team implementation
1. **Stage order was bypassed in this session.** Draft Spec/Plan files preceded Assess/Analyze and independent review. Corrective evidence: process-correction.md. Revisit drafts only in their proper stages; do not backdate handoffs or claim prior reviews.
2. **Runtime phase creation bypasses compatibility metadata and lifecycle hooks.** The runtime-authority branch of mini scripts/kbd-new-phase.mjs returns before flipProjectActivePhase and hooksFire; the corresponding full helper also exits early. Mini project.json named an earlier phase; full worktree had no project.json. Both now match the canonical phase via the authorized phase-creation postcondition repair (only activePhase changed in mini; missing full local identity derived from package.json). The phase:before hook was fired manually exactly once for this phase; do not repeat it during repair. The helper's success banner does not prove all documented postconditions.
3. **Phase completion display borrows run-wide evidence.** Full substrate/kbd-runtime/src/lib.rs phase projection constructs local implementation counts but reads evidence/certification/publication from state.completion. Therefore a fresh phase displays old publication and certification summaries. The canonical run's history is real and must be preserved; the incorrect attribution is in projection scope, not evidence to erase. Mini uses the installed shared runtime and is affected by the same contract. Never repair this by hand-editing generated progress.json.
4. **Stage reminder labels lifecycle as stage.** The reminder says Stage: ready while canonical activePath.stageId is assess and the assess stage is in_progress. Clarify lifecycle versus stage in the producer and consuming guidance.
5. **Legacy instructions prescribe editing generated state.** Full KBD prompts/assess.md asks for assessment_complete writes and references/cross-tool-protocol.md prescribes direct progress/waypoint edits, conflicting with the orchestrator's typed-command-only contract. Readers also conflate project-wide and phase-local completion. Reconcile source instructions and generated copies through their owners.
6. **Verification policy conflicts.** Full .kbd-orchestrator/constraints.md still describes documentation/file-count QA exemptions; current kbd-execute and adversarial-review explicitly remove them. Mini openspec/config.yaml still says tests first and hosted CI, while AGENTS.md A-9 requires testing completed behavior at boundaries. Mini constraints tests-for-new-features demands red/green module tests. The stricter current implementation-first/local-integration policy governs this work; align stale source text without weakening checks.
7. **Stage-gate documentation contradicts implementation.** Mini stage-gate.mjs creates the handoff directory and fails on a missing required predecessor; carried skill text still says missing directories warn and pass. Document actual behavior and require all six stages for this phase, including Analyze and Spec even though generic legacy gates may treat them as optional.
8. **Default repository scope conflicts with this explicit task.** Mini's generic reference-only full-pack rule is valid for ordinary mini-only work; this user explicitly authorizes both repositories. Record a scoped phase exception instead of broadening the global rule or changing unrelated workspace authorization.
9. **Configuration coverage is not yet defined.** 'Every option' cannot be certified by a small hand-written common schema. Analyze must identify pinned native schemas/config inventories, opaque preservation, conflict diagnostics, supported/unsupported features and installed-version validation for all eight. MiniMax global agent discovery and DeepSeek experimental teams need explicit treatment.
10. **Cross-platform proof remains pending.** Local machine is macOS with Node 26; the package contract targets Node LTS >=22 and Windows. Do not label local macOS checks as Windows or Node22 certification. Use actual local runtimes where available and record remaining evidence limits.

## Spec alignment
The current agent-team-management OpenSpec delta is a premature draft, not the baseline. It lacks complete native option matrices, cancellation/reassignment semantics, authority boundaries, multi-repository ownership and offline recovery acceptance cases. Existing platform and packaging specs constrain the implementation. Do not silently change protected tests or legacy behavior to make a new implementation pass. Each conflict correction needs traceable requirements and integration evidence before implementation.
Karpathy boundary receipts validate canonical KBD identity. Generic team messages must not be forged as successful KBD task boundaries. The pk CLI remains sole writer of .prometheus/knowledge; local team records must use a separate owned location or supported ingestion.

## Build health and coverage
- Build: UNKNOWN for this phase; no team production implementation exists.
- Tests: no new phase tests authored or run. This follows implementation-first policy; it is not a passing result.
- Existing test infrastructure exists but is not evidence for new behavior.
- Model preflight: existing Node helper reports gateway http://localhost:4000/v1, judge gpt-5.5, critic MiniMax-M3, status ok. Producer is GPT-6; actual independent review is still required.
- Prior source research and file inspection are static evidence, not native-harness execution tests.

## Goal progress
All delivered team capabilities are NOT MET; existing packaging, routing and logging are PARTIAL foundations. Process correction is IN PROGRESS. No final validation, publication or release is claimed.

## Questions for Analyze
Which existing modules can be adapted into an identical standalone TS7 runtime without repo-root imports? Which native features need per-version negotiation? How can KBD-linked team tasks share canonical ownership while non-KBD tasks remain usable? What real integration paths can verify each adapter without installing global artifacts or spending on live agent work? How should role guidance distinguish tools, skills, models and execution ownership for novices?

## Assessment limits
This is a source-based assessment of the two isolated worktrees and a narrow read-only check of related UAR discovery code. It does not establish deployed UAR/BossFang team API compatibility or certify live harness behavior. The prior architecture report is context, not current implementation evidence.

## Mini evidence
Baseline bb641a8fc569d97e19c9e3fa667ca24d7bebf43d; branch codex/agent-team-creator, based on origin/main to exclude unrelated local commits.
- lib/platform/atomic-write.mjs and lib/platform/lock.mjs; corresponding OpenSpec specs: atomic replacement, bounded Windows sharing retries, exclusive locking with explicit non-guarantees.
- lib/kbd/stage-gate.mjs and scripts/kbd-new-phase.mjs: actual stage gating and early-return defect.
- lib/karpathy/record.mjs, transport.mjs: durable canonical receipts, optional shell-free pk delivery and retry of degraded records.
- lib/distribution/package-builder.mjs: complete skill directory copying, no symlinks, Claude/Codex plugin outputs.
- lib/doctor/skills.mjs: currently verified home copies are .agents/skills and .claude/skills and refuse alongside full installation. A declared target is not an installer implementation.
- site/sidebars.js and site/scripts/generate-skills-catalog.mjs: explicit narrative navigation/category assignment plus catalog generation.
- AGENTS.md A-9/A-12/A-15 and rules/src: implementation-first boundaries, human overrides, generated rules and commit attribution.

## Auditable cross-repository evidence
The review packet file tree is rooted in one repository and depth/size-limited. The following are exact excerpts from separately inspected roots; absence from that tree is not evidence of absence.

## Publication and explicit authorization evidence
The operator explicitly requested writes to both named skill-package directories and, after completion, commit and push. See operator-authorization.md for the exact scoped instruction and continued exclusion of personal/team log pushes. Existing generic reference-only defaults do not supersede this instruction.

Current origin: `git@github.com:Prometheus-AGS/prometheus-skills-mini.git`; current committed HEAD: `5509abe715f9d302777a678be25977b3f2374248`. Both repositories have commits and an origin remote. Historic no-commits/no-remote prose is stale and must be corrected. Publication is NOT MET until applicable KBD/local gates pass; no push has occurred for this phase. Remote authentication for publication has not yet been exercised by pushing this branch.

## Unresolved review findings
Artifact review reached its two-round limit. The following findings are carried verbatim into Analyze; this is not a PASS verdict. Subsequent clarification was added after the second packet snapshot and is not claimed as reviewed.

### CRITICAL
The assessment authorizes editing the full skill-pack repository even though the packet constraints make it reference-only and forbid writes.

Evidence: Assessment says: "Identical new runtime in full and mini; edits only inside the two authorized repositories" and conflict 8 says: "this user explicitly authorizes both repositories. Record a scoped phase exception". The constraints say: "`/Users/gqadonis/Projects/prometheus/prometheus-skill-pack` | another repository | Reference only ... **Never written**, including its worktrees" and the blocking constraint `reference-repo-untouched` says: "Nothing under prometheus-skill-pack ... is created, modified or deleted".

Suggested fix: Revise the assessment to treat prometheus-skill-pack as read-only unless the packet includes an explicit constraint override; frame full-pack work as reference analysis or require an operator/constraint change before any plan edits it.

### CRITICAL
The assessment misses the goal requirement to push, including its conflict with the project constraints.

Evidence: Goals include: "Update distributions and Docusaurus, validate locally, commit and push". The assessment never analyzes a push gap or push constraint; it only says "No final validation, publication or release is claimed." The constraints state workflow commits are local only: "nothing here pushes, files or publishes (A-16)."

Suggested fix: Add a gap/conflict section for the push requirement: identify whether push is prohibited by A-16 for this phase, requires explicit human action, or needs a scoped authorization before Plan can include it.

## Disposition evidence for Analyze
- operator-authorization.md quotes the operator scope and push instructions; it supersedes conflicting generic defaults for this phase. Publication evidence now identifies actual remotes and commits.
- Full current skills/process/kbd-process-orchestrator/skills/kbd-execute/SKILL.md, Local review coverage: “File-count and documentation-only skips do not exist.” Its adversarial-review integration requires review before archive. Full AGENTS.md requires local final certification from committed state. The older constraints paragraph disagrees; the operator explicitly directed clearing these conflicts.
- Mini rules/src/constitution.md A-9 requires complete behavior before integration testing; openspec/config.yaml and the red/green warning disagree. Resolve by aligning stale derived context to the governing constitution, not by lowering required evidence.
