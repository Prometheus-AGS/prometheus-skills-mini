# Phase Reflection: agent-team-creator

The main divergences were process-state inconsistencies, packaging assumptions, and two defects found by independent review. Phase/run progress and premature Execute handoffs were corrected first. The team review then found null object acceptance and unresolved guided ownership; both were corrected and reviewed again. Live harness execution, Windows behavior, and successful remote-memory publication remain unverified.

Project: prometheus-skills-mini. Date: 2026-09-24. Implemented and archived changes: 2/2; tasks: 7/7 in this project, 14/14 across two independent ledgers. Scoped phase goals: 4/4 MET (100%); this is delivery completion, not universal harness conformance.

## Goals and evidence

| Goal | Status | Actual evidence and boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coding teams across eight harnesses | MET | Four skills and native proposal adapters for UAR, Codex, Claude, Copilot, Kimi, MiniMax mcode, OpenCode and DeepSeek; separate BossFang integration. Source contracts and serialized artifacts verified; live native execution remains unverified. |
| Novice guidance, model policy, handoff and memory | MET | Guide resolves ownership before ready team; explicit tiers/capabilities/prices and liter catalog mapping; actual revision/acceptance, unavailable-service and uncertain-retry scenarios. Local ledger is advisory; successful remote publication not certified. |
| Shared Node/TS7 implementation and docs | MET | 63 identical source/emitted/skill files; TypeScript 7.0.2 strict build; AgentSkills metadata; native exports and generated distributions; README and both local Docusaurus builds. |
| Local validation and authorized branch publication | MET | 32 packaged CLI scenarios per repo; mini compatibility 1029 pass, 0 fail, 2 existing skips; all scoped local gates pass; source commits pushed and remote SHAs verified in publication.json. |

## Delivered changes

- kbd-consistency-before-agent-teams — Codex/GPT-6 with bounded implementation workers; reviewed separately by GPT-5.5. Actual Rust runtime/journal and helper process tests cover corrected behavior.
- agent-team-creator — Codex/GPT-6 with bounded adapter, model/memory, lifecycle, documentation and integration workers. Root integrated, built, tested, reviewed, archived and published.

## Artifact quality summary

Both changes have deterministic QA and independent cumulative review. Both required corrections; first independent-review pass rate was 0/2. Prerequisite accepted at round4; team accepted at round2, with zero remaining findings. Anti-theater results are separate from substantive review. QA paths are under .refiner/artifacts/. Archived specification references were repaired and revalidated.

## Technical debt and operational limits

- Native overrides preserve every option as explicit data; they do not validate unknown native semantics. Source versions must be refreshed as harnesses evolve. Native plugins, permissions, models and process lifetimes differ.
- The ledger does not spawn, cancel, authenticate, sandbox or enforce Cedar. The selected harness owns execution. UAR/BossFang registration and activation remain explicit, separate actions.
- A local exclusive lock and atomic rename are not distributed leases. KBD preflight and result checking cannot make the canonical CLI and local state one transaction; run rollover/crash recovery remains a documented limitation.
- Remote-memory failures may be ambiguous. Durable uncertainty and explicit retry protect against silent retries but cannot promise exactly-once publication.
- Windows and live model/native service conformance were not run. Existing unrelated baseline constraint matches and run-wide blockers were preserved, not declared resolved.

## Architecture and coordination

Only the two authorized worktrees were changed. No protected full BDD test edits, global installation, other-product edits, or live service mutation occurred. Canonical task/stage transitions remain authoritative; phase-local counters no longer inherit unrelated run completion. Generated unrelated historical phase projections are excluded from the delivery. A local reviewed-runtime binary was used; this does not upgrade the installed host binary.

A team role, task owner, skill, model policy and native harness are different contracts. Independent review uses a separate dependent task; handoff acceptance transfers only that task. Ownership strings are coordination information, not access-control grants. No cross-model runtime-team claim is inferred from the isolated GPT-5.5 review.

## Lessons captured

- Complete production before integration authoring; exercise the packaged child process and actual collaborating KBD/filesystem boundaries.
- Treat AgentSkills metadata as its own standard; preserve legacy compatibility without inventing new top-level keys.
- Do not infer model availability, aliases, tiers or price from model names; unknown metadata must remain visible.
- Guided creation must resolve actual output ownership, not turn empty scope into implicit global permission.
- Keep source caches outside package parity while inspecting every packaged byte for accidental leakage.
- Separate implementation completion from archive, certification, publication and reflection to avoid circular lifecycle prerequisites or false completion.

These lessons are persisted in this tracked reflection within the authorized repositories. No personal or team knowledge-log repository was pushed.

## Recommended next phase

Native-conformance-and-studio-integration: run each installed harness against disposable native sessions, validate Windows locally, and exercise real UAR/BossFang and optional memory service contracts in an explicitly authorized environment. Then connect the-boss to the exported definitions and lifecycle receipts, with Cedar authority boundaries designed separately. No next phase was started automatically.

## Publication

Reviewed implementation commit: 628e8df06510fe905d85528c1843cff5b1cbe656. Branch: codex/agent-team-creator. Remote equality verified before reflection. Closing lifecycle/reflection evidence will be committed and pushed after the phase-end transition. Source evidence: team-verification.json, team-parity.json, generation-pass.json, review/agent-team-creator/, publication.json and correction-ledger.md.
