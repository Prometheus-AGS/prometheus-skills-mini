# KnowMe Builder

Create, adopt, extend, and maintain governed agentic applications. UAR owns
agent execution, run lifecycle, model routing, and tool governance. Prometheus
owns development workflow lifecycle and cross-harness coordination. The
Builder owns application architecture, typed adapters, generation, skills, and
conformance tests.

## Distribution boundary

This standalone skill contains the architecture references needed for design and
review. Executable generation, environment remediation, and maintained templates
belong to the versioned `knowme-builder` CLI and the trusted source checkout.
Never assume repository scripts or templates exist beside an individually
installed skill. Use the public installation guide at
<https://know-me-tools.github.io/hybrid-mobile-architecture-skill/reference/installation>
when the CLI or native harness package is required.

## Quick orientation

Read the architectural standard document before any substantial work:
`references/arch-standard.md` — this is the decision-making authority.

For platform-specific deep dives:
- Flutter patterns → `references/flutter/patterns.md`
- Tauri/React patterns → `references/tauri/patterns.md`
- Rust core patterns → `references/rust/patterns.md`
- Auth patterns → `references/auth/patterns.md`

---

## Step 1 — Environment and contract check

Before any generation or adoption, run:

```bash
knowme-builder doctor --json
```

The source checkout also provides `scripts/check-env.mjs` for maintainers. An
individually installed skill must use `knowme-builder doctor --json` instead.

### Required tool matrix

| Tool | Minimum Version | Install command |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| Rust + Cargo | 1.97.1 | `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs \| sh` |
| Flutter SDK | beta channel, latest | Follow the public installation guide |
| Node.js | 26.5.0 (current release — pin, not `--lts`) | `curl -fsSL https://fnm.vercel.app/install \| bash && fnm install 26` |
| Tauri CLI | 2.10+ | `cargo install tauri-cli --version "^2"` |
| flutter_rust_bridge_codegen | 2.12+ | `cargo install flutter_rust_bridge_codegen` |
| cargo-ndk | latest | `cargo install cargo-ndk` (Android only) |
| create-tauri-app | latest | `npm create tauri-app@latest` |

Do not attempt environment remediation unless the user explicitly requests it.

---

## Step 2 — Determine the operation

Infer the operation from the request and existing project state; ask only when the
choice is ambiguous. Read `references/project-evolution.md` for greenfield,
brownfield and ongoing upgrade workflows.

### 2a. New project

Require an explicit profile and generation mode:

```bash
knowme-builder new <path> --profile <profile> --mode runnable|skeleton
```

Profiles are `sovereign-hybrid`, `governed-web-shell`, `flutter-mobile`,
`tauri-desktop`, and `axum-web`.

### 2b. Existing application adoption

Never re-scaffold an evolved application. Preview first, then apply:

```bash
knowme-builder adopt <path> --profile <profile> --check
knowme-builder adopt <path> --profile <profile> --apply
```

Inventory actual source roots, entrypoints, dependencies, persistence and native
bridges first. Adoption metadata is not proof that missing layers or surfaces
were implemented. Preserve existing application behavior and user-owned files.
Apply requested architecture changes as bounded migrations with an executable
feature through the existing layers; do not replace the application with a new
scaffold or call disconnected generated snippets an integration.

### 2b.1. Continue evolving a previous output

Inspect `.knowme-builder/project.toml` and `generated.lock.json`, then preview:

```text
knowme-builder upgrade <path> --check
```

Review the version range, proposed files and conflicts before applying an
upgrade. Preserve local edits and original project identity. A successful file
refresh does not prove a dependency, schema or bridge migration is complete.
Unsupported versions and unresolved conflicts must be reported explicitly.
Rebuild and exercise the migrated feature on each affected surface; retain
recovery evidence. See `references/project-evolution.md` for current limitations.

### 2c. Code generation
- New feature module (Flutter or Tauri)
- New ContentBlock variant (full stack: Rust enum → Dart/TS sealed union → widget/component)
- New MCP server integration
- New SurrealDB query/store

### 2d. Audit
- Check architecture compliance against TJ-ARCH-MOB-001
- Verify state management patterns (Riverpod / Zustand + Prometheus Entity Management 3.x)
- Verify clean architecture boundaries (no direct store→API calls in components)

---

## Step 3 — Architecture rules (always enforce)

These are invariants. Violating them makes code non-compliant with the standard.

### Rust core (gen_ui_core)

1. **All networking, LLM interaction, inference, MCP, and agent logic lives in Rust.** Never re-implement these in Dart or TypeScript.
2. The crate exposes exactly one FFI surface: `api.rs` (Flutter) or Tauri commands/events (desktop).
3. One global Tokio runtime per process. Never create additional runtimes.
4. All CPU-bound work (inference forward passes, GGUF loading) uses `spawn_blocking`.
5. ContentBlock model + A2UI/AG-UI protocol pipeline is the canonical event contract between Rust and UI.

### Flutter state management (Riverpod 3.3)

Read `references/flutter/patterns.md` for the full Riverpod architecture.

**Key invariants:**
- Use `@riverpod` codegen annotations, never manual `Provider` declarations
- `AsyncNotifier` for async state; `Notifier` for sync state
- `autoDispose` on all streaming providers to prevent memory leaks
- Never access `ref.watch` outside build / provider bodies
- ContentBlock mutations happen only via `ChatNotifier.streamBlock()` — never direct state assignment
- Feature modules own their providers; cross-feature deps go through the domain layer

### Tauri + React 19 state management (Zustand 5 + Prometheus Entity Management 3.x)

Read `references/tauri/patterns.md` for the full React architecture.

**Strict layer boundary:**
```
Component → Hook → Store → [Rust IPC / API]
           ↑               ↑
      (hook only)    (store only, never component)
```

**Zustand (client-side state):**
- All client-side state lives in Zustand 5 stores
- Use `@tauri-apps/plugin-store` for Zustand persistence when state must survive restarts
- Rust-side state extension via the Tauri Zustand plugin for shared state crossing the IPC boundary

**Prometheus Entity Management 3.x (server/async/entity state):**
- Always use `@prometheus-ags/prometheus-entity-management` 3.x instead of TanStack Query
- Register each entity transport once, then read through `useEntities`, `useEntityQuery`, or `useEntity`
- Perform graph-aware writes with `useEntityMutation`; normalized entities update every subscribed view
- Never call `fetch`/`invoke` directly from a component

**TanStack Router:**
- File-based routing via `@tanstack/react-router`
- Route-level code splitting is required for routes with >3 components
- Auth guards implemented as `beforeLoad` route functions

**Visual components:**
- Components talk ONLY to hooks (`useFeatureName` pattern)
- No direct store imports in components
- No `invoke()` calls in components

**shadcn-equivalent (React):** Prefer `shadcn/ui` components over raw HTML controls with Tailwind 4. Run `npx shadcn@latest init` during scaffold.

**React chat:** Use Assistant UI for thread, composer, thread-list, streaming, attachment, and message-action behavior. Persist normalized conversation entities with Prometheus Entity Management 3.x: PGlite on web and pglite-oxide through Rust on Tauri. Zustand is transient UI state only. Apply the Flat 2.0 contract—no visible borders, divider lines, or layout shadows.

**shadcn-equivalent (Flutter):** Use `shadcn_flutter` package — see `references/flutter/patterns.md`.

### Feature-based clean architecture

Both Flutter and React follow the same feature module structure:

```
features/
  <feature-name>/
    data/          ← repositories, data sources, DTOs
    domain/        ← entities, use cases, repository interfaces
    presentation/  ← UI components/widgets, providers/hooks
```

**Dependency direction:** presentation → domain ← data

Cross-feature navigation and shared state go through the application layer (`app/`), never feature-to-feature direct imports.

### Authentication (Ory Kratos + Supabase)

Read `references/auth/patterns.md` before implementing any auth.

**Ory Kratos:** Self-hosted identity. Handles login flows, registration, MFA, sessions.
**Supabase:** Managed Postgres + Auth. RLS policies enforce row-level security.

Both are supported. Many projects use Kratos for identity (SSO, enterprise) and Supabase for database/realtime. They are not mutually exclusive.

---

## Step 4 — UAR integration (Universal Agent Runtime)

The UAR can be integrated in two modes:

**External mode (URL-based):** UAR runs as a separate service. Connect via its HTTP/WebSocket API. Use when UAR is a shared enterprise infrastructure component.

**Embedded mode:** UAR is embedded directly in `gen_ui_core`. The agent loop, MCP registry, and protocol pipeline run in-process. This is the default for standalone consumer apps (KnowMe) and field tools (Prometheus AGS mobile).

Generated applications integrate through a pinned `UarRuntimeFacade`:

- embedded implementation for mobile and local operation;
- service implementation for desktop, web, and hosted execution;
- deterministic implementation for CI.

Applications must not generate a competing agent loop. Raw MCP transport is
internal to UAR; application code invokes tools only through UAR governance.

For external mode, configure the URL in `gen_ui_core/src/config.rs` and the crate switches to HTTP client mode.

---

## Step 5 — Code generation patterns

When generating code, always:

1. Read the relevant reference file for the target platform first
2. Follow the feature-based directory structure
3. Include the correct imports (no wildcard imports)
4. Add the `// TJ-ARCH-MOB-001 compliant` marker at the top of generated files
5. For Rust: run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` on generated code mentally before outputting
6. For Flutter: follow `flutter_lints` rules
7. For React: follow the ESLint config in `references/tauri/eslint-config.md`

When adding a new ContentBlock type, always do all 7 steps in `references/rust/new-block-type.md`.
