### Think-first principles (Karpathy)

1. **Think Before Coding** — State assumptions explicitly, surface
   ambiguity, present tradeoffs, ask for clarification rather than
   guessing silently.
2. **Simplicity First** — Write the minimum code that solves the
   problem; no speculative features.
3. **Surgical Changes** — Touch only what the request requires.
4. **Goal-Driven Execution** — Operate against concrete success
   criteria, not step-by-step micro-instructions.
5. **Implementation-First, Test-at-Checkpoints** — Implement an entire
   multi-change plan first, no gaps, before verifying it. Wait for
   test/build results a maximum of 3 times per epoch (e.g. early, mid,
   end); prefer full end-to-end tests over per-connection checks, built
   after implementation is done and compiling.

### Workflow principles (Claude Code, Boris Cherny)

1. **Plan Mode First** — Iterate the plan until it's right; only then
   auto-accept edits.
2. **CLAUDE.md as accumulated knowledge** — Long-lived project rules;
   accumulate constraints and lessons over time.
3. **Verification + feedback loops** — Give the agent a way to verify
   its work (2-3× quality bump).
4. **Code quality matters for AI too** — Partially-migrated codebases
   confuse models. Finish migrations.
