## Prometheus distribution contract

This pinned upstream guidance is subordinate to the project's approved scope, design authority, framework versions, tool permissions, and phase boundary. Read PRODUCT.md, DESIGN.md, existing tokens and the affected application manifest before choosing advice. Apply relevant rules only; do not migrate frameworks or replace incumbent design by default.

Complete the implementation phase before a single consolidated verification pass; allow one batched correction and confirmation. Upstream per-edit tests, detector hooks and repetitive audit loops do not apply. Native platform execution requires its actual SDK/toolchain; portable guidance does not imply Windows can build or profile Apple applications. Never install a dependency, fetch a runtime, submit feedback, or message a third party merely because upstream suggests it.

Use the installed prometheus-ui-ux protocol for automatic selection. Taste guidance is limited to new surfaces or authorized redesign, one implementation plus at most one explicit overlay. No taste guidance applies to refinement or review. Existing DESIGN.md remains authoritative; generated recommendations and DESIGN.stitch.md cannot overwrite it without explicit authorization. User-only skills remain user-only in every harness; reading their source is not an invocation workaround.




# Full-Output Enforcement

## Baseline

Treat every task as production-critical. A partial output is a broken output. Do not optimize for brevity — optimize for completeness. If the user asks for a full file, deliver the full file. If the user asks for 5 components, deliver 5 components. No exceptions.

## Banned Output Patterns

The following patterns are hard failures. Never produce them:

**In code blocks:** `// ...`, `// rest of code`, `// implement here`, `// TODO`, `/* ... */`, `// similar to above`, `// continue pattern`, `// add more as needed`, bare `...` standing in for omitted code

**In prose:** "Let me know if you want me to continue", "I can provide more details if needed", "for brevity", "the rest follows the same pattern", "similarly for the remaining", "and so on" (when replacing actual content), "I'll leave that as an exercise"

**Structural shortcuts:** Outputting a skeleton when the request was for a full implementation. Showing the first and last section while skipping the middle. Replacing repeated logic with one example and a description. Describing what code should do instead of writing it.

## Execution Process

1. **Scope** — Read the full request. Count how many distinct deliverables are expected (files, functions, sections, answers). Lock that number.
2. **Build** — Generate every deliverable completely. No partial drafts, no "you can extend this later."
3. **Cross-check** — Before output, re-read the original request. Compare your deliverable count against the scope count. If anything is missing, add it before responding.

## Handling Long Outputs

When a response approaches the token limit:

- Do not compress remaining sections to squeeze them in.
- Do not skip ahead to a conclusion.
- Write at full quality up to a clean breakpoint (end of a function, end of a file, end of a section).
- End with:

```
[PAUSED — X of Y complete. Send "continue" to resume from: next section name]
```

On "continue", pick up exactly where you stopped. No recap, no repetition.

## Quick Check

Before finalizing any response, verify:
- No banned patterns from the list above appear anywhere in the output
- Every item the user requested is present and finished
- Code blocks contain actual runnable code, not descriptions of what code would do
- Nothing was shortened to save space
