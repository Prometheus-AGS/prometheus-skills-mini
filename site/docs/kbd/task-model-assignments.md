# Task model assignments

KBD planning recommends a concrete model for **each task**, including integration and review work. It chooses demonstrated task suitability first, within explicit user selections, project policy and budget. Cost and latency break close ties. A change-level complexity label does not choose the model for all its tasks.

This is an authored planning contract and dispatch procedure. It does not introduce a worker runtime, service or task-state schema; inspect the installed skill and native tool capabilities before using a route.

## Plan before dispatch

1. Draft tasks and resolve their backend identities.
2. Assess reasoning difficulty, uncertainty, scope, tools, context size, modalities and review independence for each task.
3. Discover the installed harness version, configured providers, exposed models, supported reasoning controls and actual worker-launch mechanism.
4. Compare task fit using dated local results or authoritative capability documentation. Label unknown or stale evidence; a model name is not evidence of quality.
5. Write one **Task model assignments** table in the active phase's plan.md and reconcile it against every emitted task before handoff.

Planning records prerequisites. It does not launch workers, change providers, start services or copy credentials into artifacts.

## The assignment key and fields

Each row is keyed by **full phase path + change ID + exact backend task ID**. For example, task 1 in changes api and docs has two distinct keys even if both display 1.1. Use the ID returned by the backend and canonical identity resolver; a displayed checkbox ordinal is not a replacement ID.

| Required field | What to record |
| --- | --- |
| Task requirements | Reasoning, uncertainty, scope, tools, context, modalities and independence |
| Provider/model | Concrete configured identity, not only small/medium/frontier |
| Reasoning effort | A supported setting, or explicitly unsupported/unknown |
| Rationale and evidence | Why it fits this task, evidence date/source and limitations |
| Harness and route | Installed harness/version and native or liter-llm inference route |
| Worker launch and handoff | Documented invocation, scope, working directory, tools, skills and result destination |
| Native alternative | Best viable native option if different; not permission to substitute |
| Availability | Configured, verified or unresolved, with evidence |
| Prerequisites | Missing model access, protocol support, gateway or tool-enabled launcher |

OpenSpec tasks.md and native KBD artifacts reference the matching rows in ordinary prose. Keep checkbox syntax and task titles unchanged. Table rows do not become extra tasks, and assignment keys do not replace canonical runtime IDs.

## Harness discovery

| Harness | Check before selecting a route |
| --- | --- |
| Codex | Exposed model choices, supported fresh-agent overrides and fork inheritance |
| Claude Code | Installed subagent model controls and the protocol required by its worker |
| OpenCode | Concrete provider/model identifiers and configured per-agent or per-invocation controls |
| DeepSeek Harness | Installed provider/agent controls; global settings do not prove per-member overrides |
| Kimi Code | Secondary-model pools and invocation controls; avoid ignored model frontmatter |

There is no permanent best-model ranking. Re-evaluate when tasks, harnesses, model access or capability evidence change.

## Native execution and liter-llm

Use the selected model natively when the harness supports it. Otherwise record two separate parts: **liter-llm supplies inference**, and an existing documented **tool-enabled worker** executes the task in the workspace. Check protocol compatibility as well as model availability.

Discover the installed tool schema or CLI documentation. Do not invent a launch_agent interface or a liter-llm complete command. An inference response alone does not prove filesystem or tool execution.

If access or a worker is missing, leave the route unresolved and record its native alternative separately. A different selection requires an explicit recorded rationale. Other eligible tasks may continue; silently substituting a cheaper or available model is not allowed.

## Execute, revise and review

Before dispatch, kbd-execute and kbd-apply recheck the exact scoped assignment and copy its reference and actual route into execution.md and the worker handoff. Workers return artifacts, results and blockers to the KBD driver. The driver owns begin/end task boundaries and canonical completion updates.

Legacy plans remain usable: perform explicit task selection at execution time before running the task. Changed, split, removed or renumbered tasks require reconciliation so each current task has exactly one current assignment.

Independent plan/artifact review and available sycophancy screening run at the completed-production boundary. Assigning an integration or review task does not authorize early verification: final integration and review follow the complete production delivery boundary. Readiness, implementation, evidence, certification and publication remain distinct.

## Separate planned selection from actual execution

Keep evidence states explicit: operator-declared catalog, configured discovery,
exposed native control, successful inference, tool-enabled worker execution and
final acceptance. Record the actual provider/model/effort and serving route in
`execution.md`, with a dated result or an unresolved limitation. A requested alias
can resolve to a different backend; its spelling is not identity evidence.
Never record a plan recommendation as an observed inference or worker result.

The portable team helper supports only `model`, `tier`, `capabilities`,
`maxInputPerMillion` and `maxOutputPerMillion`. It accumulates capabilities across
team → role → explicitly ordered skill → task layers, while scalar values
override. `low`/`medium`/`hard` are declared tiers; reasoning effort, context size,
whole-task budget and fallbacks live in plan/native evidence, not invented
portable fields. Selection filters constraints, then sorts by known price sum;
KBD's task-fit-first choice remains the planning authority.

Use the [canonical model handbook](https://prometheus-ags.github.io/prometheus-skill-system/docs/guide/agent-teams#choose-a-model-for-the-task)
for discovery, effective policy, native controls and budget limits. The
[mini-pack request example](https://github.com/Prometheus-AGS/prometheus-skills-mini/blob/main/docs/agent-teams.md#model-discovery-selection-and-persistence)
provides actual `models-discover`, `models-select` and revisioned `team-update`
requests. Both packs need Node.js 22+ for local comparison. Live discovery needs
configured endpoints; execution needs the selected native/tool-enabled worker.
Full-only card/intake and Python/Cortex controls are not mini model prerequisites.

## Budget and fallback decisions

Unknown capability/price/availability cannot satisfy its requirement. Catalog
pricing is an estimate with provenance/freshness; per-million ceilings do not
bound total tokens, reasoning, retries, multimodal usage or provider extras.
No automatic fallback chain is implemented by the team selector. An unavailable
route stays unresolved until an explicit recorded alternative respects owner
policy. A native alternative in a table is not permission to substitute silently.

For a changed task/harness/model, reconcile the exact assignment key, update its
dated rationale and record the actual dispatch. Fresh Codex controls and fork
inheritance depend on the exposed tool schema; Claude model aliases and provider
settings can affect the actual model; OpenCode variants are provider/model
specific; Kimi model frontmatter and DeepSeek static per-member settings cannot
establish the requested route. Unknown effort is recorded as unknown, not guessed.

A target coordinator receiving cross-project context selects against its own
project policy, budget, model access and worker capabilities. Source preferences
are inputs, not remote authority. Record distinct source/target repository,
canonical identity and actual route on acceptance. An issue/card or UAR direct
coordinator schema neither binds a model nor starts remote execution.

## Reviewer independence

Use separate reviewer context and record actual producer/critic identities.
This project's KBD policy requires a different model family: same-family native
fallback, a different alias or a different effort setting does not satisfy it.
A gateway name comparison is insufficient if aliases share the same underlying
provider model. Preserve actual route evidence and report unverified identity.
If no eligible reviewer is available, leave review pending until a valid route
or explicitly authorized exception exists. Final integration and review still
wait for all production work in the phase.

## Verification limits

Historical release notes reported exercises covering mixed-complexity planning, native Codex tool reads, an OpenCode worker through liter-llm, unresolved routes, legacy plans, changed tasks and repeated task numbers. Synthetic model evidence tested selection behavior, not provider rankings. The gateway's underlying provider identity and cross-model reviewer independence were not independently verified. Claude Code, DeepSeek Harness and Kimi Code execution were documentation/capability-checked only; Windows runtime was not exercised.

Those historical reports are not acceptance evidence for the current candidate; generated payloads, installed routes and final local gates require their own receipts.
